The scene where Tim Robbins crawls through 2 football fields of shits sums up what watching this movie feels like. The fact that this movie is top of the IMDb top 250 list is a sign that people on this site have no concept of good film making outside of the standard Hollywood fare. The movie may well be enjoyable, but in the end it is no more than that, enjoyable, and that is pushing it. The director's involvement with other movies outside of this speak volumes: Green Mile is in a similar mould,whilst The Mist shows his continued obsession with Stephen King. With writing credits on over five different mutations of Young Indiana Jones's, his incompetence is evident. At the end of the day, a Hollywood remake by M. Night Shyamalan of this would probably be more satisfying, and that's saying something.
