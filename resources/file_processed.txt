the shawshank redemption and to kill a mockingbird are the best movies i have ever seen. i do not judge it by it's technical merits - i don't really care about that. i have read that citizen kane or the godfather or this or that movie is the best movie ever made. they may have the best technique or be the most influential motion pictures ever made, but not the best. the best movies are ones that touch the soul. it takes a movie like the shawshank redemption to touch the soul.
