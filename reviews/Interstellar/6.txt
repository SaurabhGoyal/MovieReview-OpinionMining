It was written by the Nolan brothers: Jonathan and Christopher,who also the director of the film.

The time on Planet Earth is nearly up.Cooper,who happens to be a frustrated farmer as it has fallen victim into famine caused by overpopulation; a blight is killing crops and creating massive dust storms; and the rise of nitrogen that is going to cause asphyxiation that will cause the end of humanity.He also happens to be a former NASA Engineer and trained test pilot that lives with his children,Murp and Tom, together with his father-in-law,Donald.One night,Cooper and Murph reach into a secret underground location that was left by NASA wherein a project headed by Professor Brand that intends to find a habitable planet before the clock on earth runs out.Cooper is found to be qualified in this space exploration wherein the destination happens to be a wormhole near Saturn. He later learns that the wormhole happens to be inhabited by aliens of great intelligence that could help human beings survive the current situation and survive the conditions it is currently experiencing.Ten years back,astronauts were sent to scout a dozen possible habitable planets.But now,the human beings final destination is being determined.Mindful of his children's future,Cooper agrees to pilot the craft together with Brand's daughter, Amelia; scientists Doyle and Romilly and the sardonic robot TARS.Later,Murph grows up into adulthood forming anger towards her father.She becomes an astronaut and Brand's second-in-charge working for the same entity that took her father away from her. 

The film depicts life on earth for the first 45 minutes.It establishes how humanity is suffering and the close father-and- daughter relationship between Cooper and Murph.The theme of sacrifice is fully explored especially after the father decided to leave his daughter for an space exploration for the sake of billions of people on the planet.It eventually disappoints Murph as she finds out that he may not be able to comeback.When the story shifts into space,the journey of the space exploration becomes the focus of the film.It was good to see Christopher Nolan limit the use of CGI effects so as not to overwhelm the viewer and let them go through the narrative which happens to be far from being clichéd and predictable.The conclusion is where it takes its chances as it tries to resolve the conflicts of the story with some questions left unanswered.Despite being 3 hours long,it was far from being boring for it does not drag and the story is told in a breakneck pace.

This is a big-budgeted science fiction movie that is worth more than $160 million that has a very simple tale of love and sacrifice which later becomes breathtaking,hopeful and heartbreaking.It is another visual masterpiece from Nolan especially with the great special effects that is far from overwhelming but truly amazing.The operatic music from Hans Zimmer is also worth mentioning.The complex dialogue about the outer space can also be easily understood by the viewer regardless of one's educational background.Finally,it's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This one should definitely be seen inside a movie house for it is an awesome and incomparable theater experience.
