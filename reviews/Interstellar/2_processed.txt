a team of explorers travel through a wormhole in an attempt to ensure humanity's survival.going into this i had mixed feelings because some have praised it, others have panned it, and some say it is good with reservations. there were allegedly issues with he sound in theaters, and any number of other issues. then, when we get to the oscars, the film gets nominations in the technical fields but not in the top honors.this was wrong. maybe this is not the best role from matthew mcconaughey or anne hathaway. though, the fact that a "hathaway hater" like myself enjoyed it should say something. and i think jessica chastain should have received a best supporting nomination. she easily outshines laura dern in "wild".this may be the greatest ever film about physics.
