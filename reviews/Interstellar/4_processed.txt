a simple farm guy named copper (matthew mcconaughey) and a few other experts go into outer space to explore other worlds that might sustain human life. it seems that that life on earth might not survive due to to some unexplained environmental disaster. naturally nothing goes right.way overpraised and terrible sci-fi movie. when i heard the plot from this i expected the worst. writer/director christopher nolan has never been a favorite for me--i hate what he did to batman in his movie trilogy. i thought that he as trying to imitate stanley kubrick ("2001") here but it's far worse--he's doing steven spielberg! the movie runs way too long (165 minutes) and they're constantly pushing family friendly values in your face. cooper's non-stop yammering about his daughter got on my nerves instantly. also that stupid fake southern accent he adopts is immediately annoying. the story is very slow and all the characters are cardboard cutouts you've seen in other movies. the special effects are flawless and there's some beautiful cinematography here but the extreme length and boring story really weigh it down. any sort of statement they're trying to make on time and life is completely deadened by the script. also this movie is very manipulative and way too sentimental. they go out of their way to make the audience cry--like at a spielberg movie. well i did cry--tears of joy at the end that this was over! also the gaps in logic and plot holes here are very annoying. i lost track of how many times i rolled my eyes at the dubious "logic" served up here. the acting was as good as it could be (i guess) but, at the end, they throw in a surprise guest star (who i won't name). it didn't help because i think he's a terrible actor and this didn't change my mind. i was bored and looked at my watch many times while this played. it's boring, obvious and manipulative. why is this getting so much praise? skip it.
