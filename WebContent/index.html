		<p>Have you ever written a review for a product or service,
			Ofcourse you have. But do you know that your review does not make any
			contribution on the final rating of the product or service, only the
			rating you give is counted for that. Now you may or may not agree,
			but that is old-school and should be changed.</p>

		<p>We, here, are trying to generate the final rating of a
			product/service on the basis of your review so that the rating a
			product/service has directly reflects user's perceptions and feedback
			about it.</p>


		<p>
			We are doing it using opinion mining with the help of NLP tools and
			SENTIWORDNET. For more details and technical knowledge <a
