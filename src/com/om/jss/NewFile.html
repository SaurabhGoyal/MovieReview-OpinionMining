								* This Review contains a few spoilers*<br> <br>The
								Battle of Five Armies... The last part of a poor trilogy, it
								made me exited and gave me hope, because maybe it could be like
								the Return of The king... but no.<br> <br>This movie
								was an embarrassment for Peter Jackson, the man who just got
								himself a star on the street of Hollywood. This man turns out to
								be just like all the other Hollywood directors, a money wolf.
								This trilogy was made for nothing more than money, why 3 parts,
								why?! And half of the book isn&#x27;t even concluded in the
								movies.<br> <br>A 260 page book spread in 9 hours in
								movie could be something awesome, but it didn&#x27;t. it became
								horrible. Something that annoyed me : Added characters, no
								character development, no emotional moments, to many
								&#x27;&#x27;you got to be kidding me&#x27;&#x27; moments, no
								Dwarfs, Elve or men die in the battle. Where is there brutality
								of the LOTR? Where in the most epic battles of movie history
								everything took place : grief, death, epicness, sadness, moments
								of smiling while having a hard time trying not to let go of some
								tears, and above all, the fact that you don&#x27;t know how many
								of the good people will survive. Well in TBOFA nobody died,
								expect orcs (CGI monsters). <br> <br>And than some
								other things that made no sense, and are left out. What happens
								with the Arkenstone, who becomes king under the mountain, where
								does Tauriel go, what happens to the dwarve, what happens to the
								lake people, and what about the gems of the Elves?! Isn&#x27;t
								that what this movie was all about?? How hard was it to include
								15 minutes more and tell this. And why did Peter Jackson change
								the story about the death of Fili and Kili? Where was the love
								of brother ship? that&#x27;s what I liked about the book, it was
								about love for your brothers, not about the love of a stupid
								made up elve girl. Oh and above all, Middle- Earth looked life
								an awful ugly world, while it&#x27;s supposed to be an amazing
								wonderful world. Peter Jackson messed up big time<br> <br>I
								think this is enough for you guys to get why this movie was
								horrible compared to what it could&#x27;ve became, a story rank
								worthy to the LOTR movies.<br> <br>2/10, 1 star
								because it was Middle-Earth, and 1 star because Bilbo played an
								amazing role (oh yeah speaking of Bilbo, he looked like a side
								character, isn&#x27;t he the main character?)

								I first experienced The Hobbit at the age of 4, when my mother
								read it to me, and I have been a Tolkien fan ever since. And I
								have been generally disappointed with Peter Jackson&#x27;s take
								on The Hobbit since the beginning. Jackson abused the mythos,
								struck out trying to turn a lighthearted children&#x27;s book
								into a trio of Serious Epics, and created bloated, endless
								action scenes that did nothing to legitimately advance the plot
								(before this film, the barrel-battle and the golden dragon-dip
								were the most egregious). I honestly could not think of a single
								scene which was not addressed more effectively in the cheap
								1970s cartoon. And I found it painfully obvious that Jackson was
								trying to cheat his way to success by hitting all of the same
								notes as he did in the Lord of the Rings films, whether or not
								they made sense in this context (the character Tauriel exists
								solely to be Arwen; the character Alfrid exists solely to be
								Wormtongue).<br> <br>That last point is far and away
								my greatest complaint about the final effort. I almost
								didn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing: the ridiculous, eternal
								Battle of Five Armies wasn&#x27;t just reminiscent of
								Helm&#x27;s Deep and Minas Tirith, it WAS those battles, shot
								for shot. Jackson literally plopped the same choreography from
								his good trilogy into this film and called it done. It&#x27;s
								bad film-making, it&#x27;s lazy, and it&#x27;s just an
								inexcusable, cynical cash-grab. For instance:<br> <br>-In
								the lead-up to Helm&#x27;s Deep, a scared, desperate people
								streamed (left to right) over barren countryside into the
								fortress. In BOFA, a scared, desperate people streamed (left to
								right) over barren countryside into the ruins of Dale. <br>
								<br>-Characters hidden on a rocky outcropping witness the
								gates of a great enemy fortress open. A massive army streams
								out, while its general urges them onward from above. Is that
								Frodo and Sam at Minas Morgul or Legolas and Tauriel at
								Gundabad? <br> <br>-We had a sweeping shot of ranks of
								spear-bearing Uruk Hai before the walls, who part to allow a
								mounted leader to advance menacingly through their ranks. Now we
								have a sweeping shot of spear-baring ELVES before the walls, who
								part to allow a mounted elf-king to advance menacingly through
								their ranks. In both cases, we have shots up at the outnumbered
								defenders peering down from their hastily rebuilt fortress. In
								both cases, a prematurely fired arrow opens the hostilities. <br>
								<br>-A berserker carrying a bomb ran urgently towards the
								culvert, leaping headfirst to bring down the wall. Now we have a
								troll with a ram on his head, who runs urgently and leaps
								headfirst to bring down a wall. The Uruk Hai/orcs following
								stream together through the narrow hole, then fan out.<br>
								<br>-Gandalf rides (right to left) up the steep, winding
								streets of both Minas Tirith and Dale to warn and rally the
								citizens.<br> <br>-Characters say &#x22;Send forth the
								legions&#x22;, &#x22;Kill them all,&#x22; &#x22;The Age of the
								Orc has begun&#x22;. In both trilogies.<br> <br>-Before,
								Legolas slid on a shield (left to right) down a staircase to
								save Gimli, using the shield to impale an Uruk. Now, Bard rides
								a wagon (left to right) down a hill to save his children, using
								the cart to bowl over a troll. <br> <br>-When All is
								Lost at Helm&#x27;s Deep, a heroic younger character confronts
								the aging king, urging him to fight rather than hiding. The king
								agrees, and the small band charges out in one final desperate
								effort while a dwarf blows an impractically large horn. The
								burly character shouts &#x22;To the King!&#x22; The attacking
								Uruks are taken aback by the blinding sun and bowled aside. When
								All is Lost at Erebor, a heroic younger character confronts the
								aging king, urging him to fight rather than hiding. The king
								agrees, and the small band charges out in one final desperate
								effort while a dwarf blows an impractically large horn. The
								burly character shouts &#x22;To the King!&#x22; The attacking
								trolls are taken aback by... well, nothing, apparently... and
								bowled aside. Yeah, this one is EXACTLY the same, without even
								an effort to hide it. <br> <br>-In ROTK, Legolas makes
								his way to the head of a Mumak and brings it down by piercing
								its brain from above, causing it to crash into another Mumak,
								resulting in an earth-shaking collapse. In BOFA, Legolas makes
								his way to the head of a troll (which seems to have
								morning-stars for feet) and brings it down by piercing its brain
								from above, causing it to crash into a town, resulting in an
								earth-shaking collapse. <br> <br>-In a one-on-one
								showdown outside Minas Tirith, Eowyn faces the Witch-King, who
								is armed with a sword and an improbable mace. In a one-on-one
								showdown above Dale, Thorin faces Azog, who is armed with a
								sword-arm and an improbable mace.<br> <br>I could cite
								more examples, but I&#x27;m bumping up against the word limit. <br>
								<br>The acting in The Hobbit is generally solid -- Martin
								Freeman in particular is excellent. But Peter Jackson either ran
								out of ideas or didn&#x27;t bother trying. This film is a
								bloated, self-plagiarizing mess, and the only worthwhile moments
								are those pulled unaltered from the book.

							<p>How a wonderful book for children became a movie full of
								noise and void... Poor Bilbo... I felt sad all the time during
								this last movie, as bad as its predecessor. Unnecessary
								characters (why Tauriel, why ?!), ridiculous monsters, absurd
								scenes (Legolas jumping from crumbling stones to crumbling
								stones), fake sets, loud and empty music, there is nothing to
								save this movie. Where is the magic of The Lord of the Ring,
								where the Middle Earth looked so real ? Where is Tolkien&#x27;s
								spirit ? Why Peter Jackson could betrayed so much Bilbo ? I
								sincerely hope that he will do much better in his future
								projects ; let&#x27;s forget this trilogy...</p>

								Before seeing _The Battle of the Five Armies_ today, I told
								people, &#x22;The first two films lacked fidelity to the book,
								but this one should be better.&#x22; I figured Jackson
								wouldn&#x27;t have to add lots of extraneous invented action
								scenes because the final third of the book contained plenty of
								action.<br> <br>Boy, was I wrong.<br> <br>Unnecessary
								invented characters from the previous films continued to take up
								screen time in this one, and many new ones were added. Tolkien
								wouldn&#x27;t recognize a bunch of grand-scale evildoers or
								various &#x22;good guys&#x22; whose relationships were supposed
								to tug at our hearts, though they turned my stomach instead.<br>
								<br>The additions included plenty of trite dialogue. When
								one invented character, in a scene made from whole cloth, was
								shown weeping over a loved one and asking &#x22;Why does it hurt
								so much?&#x22;, I just about tossed my Junior Mints.<br> <br>Meanwhile,
								a character largely responsible for turning the tide in the
								book&#x27;s Battle of Five Armies (note the lack of a
								&#x22;the&#x22; before &#x22;Five&#x22;) was shown in the film,
								without explanation, for about three seconds. Blink and you
								might miss it.<br> <br>When one baddie was apparently
								killed, I thought, &#x22;If he suddenly jumps up and starts
								fighting again, I&#x27;m leaving.&#x22; Too bad I didn&#x27;t
								follow through on my threat after that excruciatingly
								predictable plot twist.<br> <br>Did I mention that
								Dain, confronting the elf warriors, came across as some
								nightmare parody of John Cleese performing &#x22;The Lord of the
								Fawlty Towers&#x22;?<br> <br>I could go on, but
								&#x22;travesty&#x22; is about the kindest word I can use for
								this mass of claptrap. I now fear that Jackson will film _The
								Silmarillion_, turning it into yet another tawdry, over-the-top
								CGI fest.

								Well the Hobbit cash grab movies are over, and they are all
								badly done but none so badly done than the last movie.<br>
								<br>Jrr Tolkien was against war, and this movie is FULL of
								pro war propaganda.<br> <br>Smaug cant hurt a single
								dwarf in his caverns so he becomes a running joke from the last
								movie, into this one. Giant dragon cant hurt anyone.<br> <br>Bard
								has to shoot the dragon by using his son&#x27;s shoulder to
								angle the arrow. What contrived baloney! The war scene that
								becomes 3/4ths of the movie is hilarious...I laughed as Legolas
								flipped a million times, ran up falling stones, wrestled 8 foot
								orcs and won. 8 foot orcs with gigantic arms losing to 5 ft
								skinny characters just my brain with the lack of realism.<br>
								<br>One war scene shows gigantic trolls, just falling over
								dead because Thoren decides to charge them. I don&#x27;t even
								see anything hit them, they just fall over.<br> <br>The
								stupid forced love affair is stupid between Dwarf and Elf, just
								a cash grab to bring in women watchers.<br> <br>The
								fight against Sauron is so stupid. They show a close up of
								Sauron&#x27;s eye over and over, as the wizard nerds all chant
								at him. Why don&#x27;t they finish him off....durrr...cause he
								can only destroy the world with the one ring? So why not let him
								go? And the mandatory poor connection to the Lord of Rings
								films. Just so you don&#x27;t puke yourself crazy at how bad
								this film is on its own. No one is Hollywood has any respect for
								fans, its all about money, money, money. This cash grab is also
								hilarious because it says that obsessing about money is
								evil...through over explained dream sequences lol. Thoren
								&#x22;drowning in gold dream&#x22;, for the idiots out there.

								This &#x22;movie&#x22; is definitely worthy of being thrown into
								the fire! My in-laws gave us the tickets (to be fair - we would
								have been so stupid and payed for it ourselves... so... there
								you go: We FINANCED further abominations like this!) Whatever
								happened to good, decent filmmaking? This was a terrible,
								over-the-top, soulless WAR MOVIE!!! It feels as numb and
								un-emotional as a general anesthetic. There were main-characters
								dying? Oh, true... well, who cares? Remember anyone the death
								scene of Sean Bean in THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING (yes, he always
								dies - but he died really well in that one) Oh, or who the F
								cares about some CGI-Mega-Orc fighting a dwarf on ice Flash
								Gordon Style? And also: Did he touch the ground of that frozen
								lake before he jumped back to ruin some more or less decent
								CGI-Death-Scene? - or did he do the Legolas &#x22;I don&#x27;t
								care about gravity&#x22; thing? Questions above questions - yet
								now answers! I&#x27;d like to ask Peter Jackson what the hell
								happened! Was he forced with a gun to his head to make this? Or
								did he just direct it from a smart-phone, while sitting on his
								couch at home and counting his money? Yes, I&#x27;m aware that
								the TRUE EVIL, the true Morgoths are the Studios and the
								endlessly greedy film industry! If young people like Playstation
								graphics and action, shaky-cam and *beep* 3D - let them have it!
								Who cares about nice cinematography when the highest grossing
								movie are made in absurd-looking 3D and with completely
								over-the-top everything! In the last 14 years since the
								FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING came out, I was telling my nerdy friends
								(and everybody else) how amazing the Lord of the Rings movies
								are, how muche love and effort went into them.<br> <br>I
								was amazed about the fact, that Peter Jackson said NO to too
								much CGI, that he used real sets, models, amazingly detailed
								costumes and beautiful cinematography.<br> <br>ALL of
								that went down the drain with this one... this boring, crappy
								looking CGI-disaster, this Mexican Standoff in Middle Earth.<br>
								<br>What was the &#x22;story&#x22; again? Some greedy dwarf
								does not want to come out of his cave - and suddenly all kinds
								of armies show up... to fight each other in a ridiculous way...<br>
								<br>The last 10 minutes then felt like some different
								move... somehow like the original Trilogy... BECAUSE THERE WERE
								REAL LANDSCAPES.<br> <br>It felt like something really
								beautuful standing next to something really ugly. But this short
								moment of &#x22;how to make a nice, decent, GOOD movie&#x22; did
								not save and also not redeem this perversion of cinematic
								history! This could as well be titled: WORLD OF WARCRAFT - THE
								MOVIE.<br> <br>Other titles: Legolas, Dwarfes,
								CGI-ORCS and other stupid stuff in: TO HELL WITH GRAVITY!
								Watching THE FELLOSHIP OF THE RING makes you believe in the good
								things in this world: Friendsip, beauty, decency, good
								filmmaking... everything that is right and just and good.
								Everything a guy like Aragorn would put into an epic speech
								before a battle that mattered.<br> <br>The
								battlescenes of the CGI-Creatures did not matter. And having too
								many trolls with too many artificial limbs - or an Orcs with a
								Klingon Bathleth-Prosthesis (and I usually like STAR TREK
								references... maybe just not in a Middle Earth Movie) I am not
								just disappinted. I am shocked by this mess. How can the SAME
								director that made the BEST TRILOGY EVER do this? Well, the same
								question has been asked countless times about George Lucas.<br>
								<br>Good Job, Peter - you killed filmmaking. I am also not
								sure if you are honest about promoting this disgusting gimmick
								called 3D or you just have to do it because the industry wants
								you to do so! Damn it - this is the time of bad movies gone too
								far, the age of darkness... J.R.R. Tolkien could write some
								words of truth about this - but he&#x27;s dead (lucky him... so
								he does not have to bear what they did to his beautiful vision!)
								This is the age of darkness indeed. The age of greed! I tend to
								believe that it is not completely Peter Jackson&#x27;s fault -
								it is the perverted, greedy film-industry. They do not think in
								art or beauty or decency - they think and care only about
								profit! They exploit everything.<br> <br>The sad part
								is the people defending all that because the wrongly connect it
								to something that is good and beautiful. But the connection is
								wrong! Just because it has partly the same actors, the same
								director and is supposed to play in the same universe as the
								good trilogy does not make it the same.<br> <br>George
								Lucas tried (and failed) in doing the same. Overkilling
								something with CGI and bad writing is not filmmaking - it&#x27;s
								a shame! Personally, I do the same here that I do with this
								terrible STAR WARS PREQUEL TRILOGY: I never watch it again. I
								imagine the events of Bilbo&#x27;s adventure with the dwarfes
								from the visual and artistic perspective of Ian Holm in THE
								FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS - there could still be something great
								being made - but please by another director.<br> <br>Somebody
								young and hungry and talented. Some person like the Peter
								Jackson of the 1990s. Somebody who LOVES the source-material and
								has a vision of it - but not a financial one! What also works -
								and it&#x27;s totally for free: Imagination. Having a good actor
								talking about something rather than showing it invokes a million
								times more beautiful images than cramming it down your throat
								with a CGI funnel! Anyway - whatever. This needed to be said!
								And somebody like RED LETTER MEDIA should really make a review
								similar to the STAR WARS PREQUEL reviews! May the Force be with
								you - Gandalf

								movies, the book, and collect all the trinkets and art books I
								can.), and since the Desolation of Smaug had been a quite good
								movie, and I had heard Peter Jackson claim this film was going
								to be even more serious and thriller-y, I naturally assumed it
								was going to be a dark, thrilling movie that had me on the edge
								of my seat.<br> <br>This was not the case.<br> <br>The
								movie started with an extremely anticlimactic scene that killed
								suspension of disbelief, and continued on the same track. Smaug,
								while a masterpiece of animation, was disappointing, as was most
								of the movie. The film continued, and I was more and more
								confused- this is not the movie I had expected. It lacked a good
								plot, was confusing even to me(who has read the book and the
								production books five times over), and COULD NOT DECIDE WHAT IT
								WANTED TO BE.<br> <br>One second, it was comedy, and
								while some scenes were amusing enough, some were just
								cringe-worthy(Peter Jackson&#x27;s horrendous comic timing
								making itself known), but these scenes completely ruined the
								atmosphere of the film, making it dull and bland instead of
								tense and exciting. <br> <br>The only saving grace
								this piece of badly directed trash had were the scenes with the
								King of the Dwarfs, Thorin, succumbing to madness, and his
								relationship dynamic with Bilbo(who had very little screen time
								for a film about him) These scenes were brilliant, mostly
								because of the heartfelt and excellent acting of Richard
								Armitage and Martin Freeman.<br> <br>Sadly, even
								though one feels these scenes should be in center, the movie
								chooses to focus on dull battle sequences. The scenes that are
								truly good are hastily skipped over, and we move to classic bad
								PJ comedy and awful battle scenes. While in Lord of The Rings
								there were some goofy battle scenes, this movie almost seems
								like it&#x27;s trying to make a parody of itself. I did not find
								many problems with Legolas&#x27;s gravity defying skills in
								Desolation of Smaug, but here, it makes you wonder if Middle
								Earth is actually the moon in regards to the gravity-free
								atmosphere.<br> <br>Other than the terrible battle
								scenes, we have the focus on a romance plot so bad it almost
								makes me blush of second-hand embarrassment. It&#x27;s like the
								movie is trying to emulate elements from Titanic, but fails
								miserably. The romance was so forced it might as well be a
								spoof, and was a complete waste of a female character. I am in
								favor of female characters being added to the story. In fact, I
								love it. But here? It is so blatantly clear Tauriel was only
								added to be Kili&#x27;s love interest, and it hurts my heart to
								see female character&#x27;s butchered in this way.<br> <br>(And
								that&#x27;s not even mentioning the atrocity that was making
								Galadriel, who is the strongest person in middle-earth, laying
								on the floor sobbing and waiting for her strong male wizard
								companions to help her.) <br> <br>The death scenes of
								some of the characters were underwhelming, except for one, which
								was emotional enough to make me give this movie my
								almost-approval, but it is just as many of us feared: This movie
								gives no screen time or attention to dwarfs who are not Thorin
								Oakenshield and Kili(we don&#x27;t even see them fight in this
								movie. They just stand in the background.)<br> <br>So,
								to sum it up, if you expect a thrilling experience, you&#x27;re
								out of luck. The movie was generally poorly paced, poorly
								directed, with really awful CGI, conflicts that were created,
								solved and sometimes forgotten in the blink of an eye, and an
								excess of Legolas.(WHO IS LITERALLY JUST THERE TO LOOK PRETTY
								AND DO STUNTS.). It is a worth watch if you&#x27;re a fan, but
								only for a couple of scenes that the director seemed to have
								deemed unimportant despite them being the only reason this movie
								was even worth the name. Tasteless jokes, awful fight scenes,
								terrible cheesy romance that puts the notebook to shame, and
								more questions than answers in the end. Peter Jackson truly did
								not deliver, even though it&#x27;s clear he tried. <br> <br>He
								simply tried too much.

								I despise Desolation of Smaug, so I can assure you I went in
								with minuscule expectations. Even those were shattered. I have
								disregarded the book in this review, because the book was ruined
								back in Desolation of Smaug. I watched this as a movie, ignoring
								everything I knew about how it was meant to go. <br> <br>Picking
								up exactly where Desolation left off, Smaug comes to his fiery
								end within ten minutes of the film&#x27;s beginning, which only
								serves to highlight the terrible decision to split the film into
								three and to make the cuts where they did. We then spend roughly
								forty minutes waiting for the infamous 45 minute battle scene to
								begin, and then plead for it to end. Unlike the gripping, tense
								and endlessly entertaining battle sequences in LOTR, these
								CGI-heavy storms contained no sense of danger or drama. The laws
								of physics are suspended to the point where most people in the
								audience were laughing, and the hideous and unexplained fan
								service gives the impression that the film was directed by a 11
								year old boy with some magic markers. <br> <br>Once
								again the screenwriters run out of Tolkein to fill 2 and a half
								hours, so invent their own, and the result is cringe-worthy
								dialogue about love. At the film&#x27;s conclusion, barely any
								character is given any resolution save for Legolas (who
								doesn&#x27;t appear in the book at all) and to a degree Bilbo
								himself. <br> <br>Martin Freeman performs well as
								Bilbo, nailing nearly every scene he is in. However, nearly
								every big name actor in the film collects around 2 minutes of
								screen time (everyone from Blanchett to Connelly) and most of
								them feel as if they are going through the motions. Blanchett in
								particular is given a particularly cringe-worthy part and I hope
								she was paid well. An unrecognisable and CGI-heavy Billy
								Connelly gives probably the least inspired performance in the
								film as Dain, whose role is so heavily reduced that it probably
								doesn&#x27;t matter. Ryan Gage&#x27;s Alfrid is so painfully
								unnecessary and uninspired that he brings down the movie in
								every scene he appears. <br> <br>Each of the
								film&#x27;s deaths is anti-climactic and changed for the worse.
								The Lord of the Rings trilogy features some of the best
								cinematic deaths ever - Boromir, Theoden, The Witch-King, the
								Cave Troll, the Balrog/Gandalf. None of these fare even close.<br>
								<br>Most unforgivingly, the film pathetically pretends to
								be Lord of the Rings. We first see hints of it when Saruman,
								Galadriel and Elrond storm into Dol Goldur and Galadriel
								reprises her role as Green Witch from Fellowship, but it becomes
								far more blatant later on. BOFA blatantly steals the LOTR
								Oscar-winning score, it recreates key scenes from Two Towers but
								replaces the terrifying Uruk-hai with generic CGI white orcs, it
								sends Legolas off to find Aragorn (which makes no sense) and the
								final scene is literally taken word for word from the Fellowship
								of the Ring.<br> <br>In Conclusion, please AVOID this
								film if you have an appreciation for film, Tolkein books, the
								laws of physics or practical effects. Watch only if you want a
								demonstration of CGI excess, a Martin Freeman performance (which
								you can find elsewhere) or are a prisoner whose only escape is
								by watching this film. Otherwise, please just watch the Lord of
								the Rings instead.

								I love the first 5 movies by Peter Jackson and this completely
								disappointed me...The battle could have been much more epic but
								the problem lies with all of the extra plot lines Peter Jackson
								decided to throw in (that weren&#x27;t in the book). Because of
								those, the movie was forced to focus on tying up any loose ends
								dealing with those added characters and plots. So, the movie
								didn&#x27;t do justice to just how important of a battle this
								was in Middle Earth history.<br> <br>Also, what
								happened to the elves half way through the battle? In the book,
								there are supposed to be over 1000 of them. And they don&#x27;t
								retreat in the middle of battle.<br> <br>And why did
								Jackson leave out Beorn?? So Thorin could get all of the glory?
								Dumb...

								In this film you will see: Animated fights containing dwarfs.
								Animated fights containing elves. Animating fights containing
								humans. Animated fights containing orcs. Superlarge animated
								worms which digs through unnoticeable through the ground.
								Characters you don&#x27;t care about dieing. Plot devices
								everywhere. Eagles saving the day... once more... for no reason.
								Animated animations doing animated things. Legolas breaking even
								more laws of physics (seriously, that dude must be a god or
								something.. He jumps like... 30 meter, onto a giant troll which
								is about 7 meters tall, sticks a knife in his brain,
								mindcontrols him to knock down a tower which later on becomes a
								bridge which he will fight another giant orc which will almost
								die like 123 times and then at the end die once and for all....
								lol jk he survived but noes, now he did die and lol we&#x27;re
								happy ohno he survived anyway OK now legolas killed him). A love
								story which feels awfully forced and pointless (srsly... who
								cares???). Countless forced references to lord of the rings
								(also sersly... we get it... the hobbit is a prequel, okay, let
								it go.).<br> <br>And lots more. I can go on forever.
								This film was awful, i feel cheated in so many ways.
